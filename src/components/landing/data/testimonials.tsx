    quote: "Beige Media was fantastic to work with in all phases of my keynote engagement. We had a pre-event call where I provided the vision for my speaking engagement, and they delivered. Some of the raw footage came out a bit shaky, but it was because the tripod failed in the middle of my speech. Somehow, it was fixed during the editing process!\n\nI will be working with Beige again for future engagements.",

    quote: "Absolutely Incredible Experience – More Than We Ever Dreamed Of!\n\nWe cannot put into words how grateful we are for the exceptional work Beige did for our wedding! From our first consultation to the final delivery of photos and video, everything was seamless and professional.\n\nThe photographers and videographers were not only talented, but warm, kind, and incredibly easy to work with. They made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera, captured every important moment beautifully, and somehow managed to catch the magic in between—the laughter, the glances, the emotion we’ll never forget.\n\nThe final gallery and video left us speechless. Every shot was vibrant, timeless, and filled with meaning. They didn’t just document our wedding—they told our story.\n\nIf you’re looking for a company that will go above and beyond, treat your day like it's their own, and deliver stunning, high-quality work that you'll treasure forever—Beige is the team to hire. They are absolute professionals, and genuinely wonderful people.",

    quote: "We had a great experience working with the Beige team for our Halloween event. They were punctual, friendly, and professional, and followed our shot list and brief closely, capturing all the content we needed. While post-production could have been a bit faster for our social deadlines, they still delivered everything within the promised timeframe, provided a strong set of edited photos, and created an excellent recap video with two rounds of revisions. Overall, they met expectations and were great partners to work with.",

    quote: "I recently worked with Beige Media for a wedding in October, and I can’t recommend them highly enough. As a photographer, finding a videographer who collaborates well, communicates clearly, and respects the flow of the day is incredibly important — and Beige Media exceeded every expectation. Their team was professional, attentive, and easy to work with from start to finish. They checked in before, during, and after the wedding to make sure we were aligned and fully supported, which I truly appreciated. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with them again and highly recommend them to any couple or vendor team looking for exceptional video coverage.",

They were efficient and mindful of the quick turnaround times needed. My team had a need for a video for a food manufacturing company and Beige worked within our budget and requests. We appreciate everyone from the videographer capturing the shots needed and more to the pre-production team setting us up and coordinating timelines to the post production team who handled the edits and requests.

I received a very fast response and within a few hours I had explained my needs, collaborated on various options, received a proposal, approved it and was handed off to Maddie my client manager. She took care of all the pre-production details, and ran a virtual meeting with me, the videographer, post-production team and herself to lock down every single detail.\n\nEverything ran smoothly before the shoot and during. Chris (videographer) showed up early for the shoot and was ready. He reviewed my needs and was happy to accommodate me. He was also flexible and creative in how he worked at my venue which presented a couple of challenges.\n\nI couldn't be more pleased or impressed with the Beige team. I'd hire them again in a second!",

The team did everything they could to accommodate my own last minute requests and they made what could have been a stressful situation into a seamless, easy process. The footage was outstanding, my clients were thrilled with the crew, and I couldn't have asked for anything more.",

I run a nonprofit organization that supports young adults who are pursuing their college education and I have hired Beige to record and edit and photograph a panel that we spoke on at ASU and to record and edit testimonials for our scholars in Arizona and Missouri. Kawser and his team are very responsive and their representatives, videographers, photographers and editors are very professional, communicative and timely. The quality of video and photos they produce is absolutely amazing!
